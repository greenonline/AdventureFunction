Procedural Dungeon Map

From an article, **Repeatable functions for limitless mazes** by *G.T.Relf*, in [Practical Computing March 1982][1], page 93

Listing 1: Code example using cosine to generate random numbers

Listing 2: **Mammoth Maze**

Note: There is an omission, in the published listing, at line 250 to call the random number generator. This is fixed in `LISTING1_FIXED.BAS`.
