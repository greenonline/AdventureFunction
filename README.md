Procedural Dungeon Map

From an article, **Repeatable functions for limitless mazes** by *G.T.Relf*, in [Practical Computing - March 1982][1], page 93

## Listings

 - Listing 1: Code example using cosine to generate random numbers
 - Listing 2: **Mammoth Maze**
   - Note: In the published listing, there is an omission, at line 250, to call the random number generator. This is fixed in `LISTING2_FIXED.BAS`, by: moving line 250 to 255, and; adding lines 245 (REM) and 250 (GOSUB).
